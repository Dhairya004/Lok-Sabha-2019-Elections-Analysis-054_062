# Analysis of the 2019 Lok Sabha election candidates

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the qualifications of Lok Sabha candidates and enable citizens of India to take informed decisions while voting. We analysed things like educational qualifications and criminal records of the candidates, and discovered the role of gender, age, and educational qualification in the number of criminal records on a candidate. Some of the pages and charts created by us are shown below.
